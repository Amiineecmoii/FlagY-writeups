##M47H – Reverse Engineering Writeup

Category: Reverse Engineering
Flag format: FlagY{}

Challenge Description : 

They say that C/C++ is old, so maybe it’s time to move on to something new.
But does using a “modern” language really make reversing harder?

This challenge provides a Windows executable that validates a flag using a non-trivial verification routine.
Our goal is to reverse the binary and recover the correct flag.

## File Information : 
$ file M47H.exe
```bash
M47H.exe: PE32+ executable (console) x86-64, for MS WindowsFile Information
```
